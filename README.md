# A mini-exhibit map for colleagues in the DHR Easements program

This story map was built for a kiosk at the [VaULT land conservation conference](https://vaunitedlandtrusts.org/annual-conference/) from April 8-10, 2019. The goal is to provide a quick interactive look at urban historic preservation easements held by DHR's Board of Historic Resources in Richmond. 

Data here do not reflect the entirety of DHR easements, nor do they show all of the historic preservation easements in Richmond. To learn more about DHR's easement program, visit https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/easements/. 



Forked from https://github.com/DataVizForAll/leaflet-storymaps-with-google-sheets, which allows colleagues the ability to add map content without code. See links to the full tutorial below.
